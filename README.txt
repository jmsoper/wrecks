A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/RPvxGp.

 Revisiting my old [CSS Text Filling with Water](http://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/xrwja) pen for an article, this time made with SVG, for hopefully better support.

This time, animating with JS, since some browsers don't support animating the x/y properties through CSS.
